## WHAT IS  ITERATIVE AND RECURSIVE APPROACH
interative approach is Uses loops (e.g., for, while) to repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition is met.
   - Typically more memory-efficient because it doesn't involve the overhead of function calls.
   - Easier to debug and understand for simple problems.
## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Iterative Approach:
   - More memory-efficient (O(1) space complexity).
   - Easier to implement for simple problems.
   - Preferred for performance-critical applications.
## WHAT RECURSIVE APPROACH
recursive approach is Solves problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and calling itself to solve these subproblems.

Requires a base case to terminate the recursion.
Can be more intuitive for problems that naturally fit a recursive structure (e.g., tree traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms).
May use more memory due to the call stack.
## SUMMARYOF FINDING
Recursive Approach

More intuitive for problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems.
Slightly higher space complexity due to the call stack (O(log n)).
Can lead to stack overflow for very large inputs.
